Usage
=====

Confctl is a tool designed for easy access to configuration files in C-like
syntax from shell scripts.  For example, if you have a configuration file
that looks like this:

interfaces {
	eth0 {
		ip-address	192.168.1.1
		mtu		9000
	}

	eth1 {
		ip-address	192.168.2.1
		description	"Uplink to Telia"
	}
}

... then you can access all the variables like this (note the "-a" option):

% confctl -a config-file
interfaces.eth0.ip-address=192.168.1.1
interfaces.eth0.mtu=9000
interfaces.eth1.ip-address=192.168.2.1
interfaces.eth1.description="Uplink to Telia"

You can also query individual variables:

% confctl config-file interfaces.eth0.ip-address interfaces.eth1.ip-address 
interfaces.eth0.ip-address=192.168.1.1
interfaces.eth1.ip-address=192.168.2.1

To modify a variable, use the "-w" option:

% confctl -w interfaces.eth0.ip-address=192.168.1.2 config-file

You can modify pass the "-w" option multiple times to set several variables
at once.  You use exactly the same syntax to add new variables:

% confctl -w interfaces.eth2.ip-address=10.0.0.1 -w interfaces.eth2.netmask=24 config-file
% confctl config-file interfaces.eth2
interfaces.eth2.ip-address=whatever
interfaces.eth2.netmask=24
% cat config-file

interfaces {
	eth0 {
		ip-address	192.168.1.1
		mtu		9000
	}

	eth1 {
		ip-address	192.168.2.1
		description	"Uplink to Telia"
	}

	eth2 {
		ip-address	10.0.0.1
		netmask		24
	}
}

Note that file modification preserves formatting and indentation.  It also
preserves all the comments, including ones for variables modified in place.

Also note that by default, modification is done by writing a temporary
copy of the file, in the same containing directory, and then renaming
it, replacing the old file.  This will fail if it's impossible to create
new files, and won't do the right thing when the file name is a symlink.
In that case, use "-I" option to rewrite configuration file in place.
