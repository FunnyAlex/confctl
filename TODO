Things to do before 1.1:

 - Add modification regression tests to jail.test (depends
   on above three items).

 - Add test for unvis(3) in confvar_from_line().

 - Add test for names with dots.

 - Add an option for '/* comments */'.  Perhaps make -C enable them, along with '//' ones?

 - Make line parser behave reasonably about spaces around '='.

Things to do before calling it done:

 - Properly bail out on EOF without closing curly brackets.

 - Consider rewriting the parser using regexps; it's getting complicated.

 - Mimick cv_middle from existing entries, so that newly added
   variables get a proper spacing between variable name and value.

 - Mimick cv_after from existing entries, so that newly added
   variables get a semicolon, if the rest of the file uses it.

 - Currently we always treat names without values as names,
   so things like 'meh { 1; 2; 3 }' became 'meh.1=\n meh.2\n meh.3'.
   Add an option to make them as values without names, like this:
   'meh=1\n meh=2\n meh=3'.  This would make nicer output for
   JunOS-like config.

 - Consider adding some automatic quote handling.

 - The whole cv_reindent() looks fishy.

 - Add confctl_var_to_line().

 - Add confctl_var_find_one(struct confctl_var *parent, const char *path)

 - Add confctl_var_move_after(struct confctl_var *cv, struct confctl_var *sibling);

 - Build shared library.
