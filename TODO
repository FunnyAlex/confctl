Things to do before calling it done:

 - properly bail out on EOF without closing curly brackets.

 - Handle escaping and quoting in printing routines.

 - Support syntax like this: 'whatever "name" { some stuff }'.

 - Support appending semicolons to newly added entries.

 - Handle 'var = value' syntax when adding new variables.
   This requires mimicking cv_middle from existing entries.

 - Handle semicolons at the end when adding new variables.
   This requires mimicking cv_after from existing entries.

 - Add modification regression tests to jail.test (depends
   on above two items).

 - Consider rewriting the parser using regexps; it's getting complicated.

 - Handle newlines in names or values in a sane way, perhaps by escaping them.
