Things to do before 1.1:

 - Make confvar.c a proper shared library.

 - Add an option (-C, perhaps), to recognize '//' as a comment.

 - Add an option (-E, perhaps) to use '=' as a separator between
   name and value.  This requires mimicking cv_middle from existing
   entries.

 - Add an option (-S, perhaps) to use semicolon after entry.
   This would also change the way line continuation works
   ('variable\n value;' would be ok, without the need to escape
   the newline).

 - Add modification regression tests to jail.test (depends
   on above two items).

 - Use unvis(3) in confvar_from_line().

Things to do before calling it done:

 - Properly bail out on EOF without closing curly brackets.

 - Consider rewriting the parser using regexps; it's getting complicated.

 - Mimick cv_middle from existing entries, so that newly added
   variables get a proper spacing between variable name and value.

 - Mimick cv_after from existing entries, so that newly added
   variables get a semicolon, if the rest of the file uses it.

 - Currently we always treat names without values, so things
   like 'meh { 1; 2; 3 }' became 'meh.1=\n meh.2\n meh.3'.
   Add an option to make them as values without names, like this:
   'meh=1\n meh=2\n meh=3'.  This would make nicer output for
   JunOS-like config.
