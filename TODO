Things to do before calling it done:

 - properly bail out on EOF without closing curly brackets.

 - Handle escaping and quoting in printing routines

 - Handle duplicates ('1 { some var } 2 { yadda yadda } 1 { some other var }')

 - Support syntax like this: 'whatever "name" { some stuff }'

 - Support appending semicolons to newly added entries

 - Handle 'var = value' syntax.  This requires mimicking cv_middle from existing
   entries

 - Handle semicolons at the end.  This requires mimicking cv_after from existing
   entries.

 - Add modification regression tests to jail.test.

 - Consider rewriting the parser using regexps; it's getting complicated.

 - Handle newlines in names or values in a sane way, perhaps by escaping them.
