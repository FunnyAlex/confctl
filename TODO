Things to do before 1.0:

 - Bring back '// comments', perhaps by adding an option to enable them.

 - Handle zero-length names ("var val; { meh }").

Things to do before calling it done:

 - properly bail out on EOF without closing curly brackets.

 - Handle 'var = value' syntax when adding new variables.
   This requires mimicking cv_middle from existing entries.

 - Handle semicolons at the end when adding new variables.
   This requires mimicking cv_after from existing entries.

 - Add modification regression tests to jail.test (depends
   on above two items).

 - Consider rewriting the parser using regexps; it's getting complicated.

 - We probably should use unvis(3) in confvar_from_line().
